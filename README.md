# DeepLearning_CancerCellClassification

For a graduate class on machine learning, I built a convolutional neural network to analyze images of breast cancer cells and correctly classify images with cancerous cells.

Data used in this project comes from <https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/breast-histopathology-images>
